      and the use of plain text http is strongly discouraged due to the

      Additionally the path to the proxy interface needs to be supplied as
      well in case Grafana is placed in a sub directory of the web server.

    type: string
    description: |
      Mapping of datasource metrics to Grafana queries. Values should be
      strings for which the .format method will transform it.
      The transformation offers five parameters to the query labeled {0} to
      {4}. {0} will be replaced with the aggregate, {1} with the resource
      attribute, {2} with the period, {3} with the granularity and {4} with
      translator specifics for InfluxDB this will be the retention period.
      These queries will need to be constructed using tools such as Postman.
      Example: SELECT cpu FROM {4}.cpu_percent WHERE host == '{1}' AND
      time > now()-{2}s
